# Handlers

Handlers are functions that are called when an event is triggered. Handlers are registered with the calling `add_handler` funciton of app or using [`decorators`](./decorators).

## Handler functions

Handler functions are functions that are called when an event is triggered. They are registered with the `add_handler` function of the app. 
The function must accept a single argument, which is the [`BotContext`](./context) containig the info of the bot and the event.

There are one handler class for each event type. The handler class name is the same as the event class, but with the `Handler` suffix.


## Creating handlers

All handlers can be created calling the constructor of the handler class. The constructor accepts two arguments: the handler function, and a [filter](./filters) or a group of filters.

Each handler receives function (the first argument of the Handler) receives a BotContext[T] (where T is one of the EventTypes) as an argument. The BotContext contains the bot and the event that triggered the handler.

To define a handler callback function you must use the `async def` syntax, and the function must accept a single argument, which is the BotContext[T] of the event.

This is an example of how to create a handler function for each type of event:

```python
from swibots import BotApp, BotContext, MessageEvent, CommandEvent, CommandHandler, MessageHandler

app = BotApp("token", "your bot description")

async def message_handler(ctx: BotContext[MessageEvent]):
    await ctx.event.message.reply_text(f"Thank you! I received your message: {ctx.event.message.message}")

app.add_handler(MessageHandler(message_handler))

async def command_handler(ctx: BotContext[CommandEvent]):
    await ctx.event.message.reply_text(f"Thank you! I received your command: {ctx.event.command}")

app.add_handler(CommandHandler('THE_COMMAND', command_handler))

app.run()
```


## Registering handlers

Handlers are registered with the `add_handler` function of the app. The function accepts a single argument, which is the handler function.

This is an example of how to register a handler function:

```python
from swibots import BotApp, MessageHandler

app = BotApp("token", "your bot description")

async def message_handler(ctx: BotContext[MessageEvent]):
    await ctx.event.message.reply_text(f"Thank you! I received your message: {ctx.event.message.message}")

app.add_handler(MessageHandler(message_handler))

app.run()
```

## Chat handlers

### Message Handler

The `MessageHandler` is a handler for the `MessageEvent`. It is called when a message is sent to a chat.

#### Properties

- `callback` (`Callable[[BotContext[MessageEvent]], Awaitable]`): The callback function that will be called when the event is triggered.
- `filter` (`Filter`, optional): The filter that will be used to filter the event. (Default: `None`)

#### Example
```python
from swibots import BotApp, MessageHandler, MessageEvent, BotContext

# create app and call it app
app = BotApp('TOKEN')

# handler callback function
async def message_handler(context: BotContext[MessageEvent]):
    message = context.event.message
    await message.reply_text("Hello world!")

# register handler
app.add_handler(MessageHandler(message_handler))
```

### Command Handler

The `CommandHandler` is a handler for the `CommandEvent`. It is called when a command is sent to a chat.

- `filter` (`Filter`, optional): The filter that will be used to filter the event. (Default: `None`)

#### Example
```python
from swibots import BotApp, CommandHandler, CommandEvent, BotContext

# create app and call it app
app = BotApp('TOKEN')

# handler callback function
async def command_handler(context: BotContext[CommandEvent]):
